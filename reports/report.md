# Customer Funnel & Revenue Leakage Analysis

## Executive Summary
This analysis examines the customer journey from initial website visit to purchase using event-level data. The goal was to identify funnel drop-offs and quantify conversion performance across key stages.

The results show a significant decline between the **Signup** and **Add to Cart** stages, indicating potential friction in product value communication, pricing, or user experience.

## Dataset Overview
- Synthetic, GDPR-safe dataset
- ~2,000 users
- Countries: UK, DE, FR, NL, ES, IT
- Event types: Visit, Signup, Add to Cart, Purchase

---

## Funnel Performance
Key funnel stages analyzed:
- Visit → Signup
- Signup → Add to Cart
- Add to Cart → Purchase

Conversion rates decrease steadily across the funnel, with the largest drop occurring after signup.

---

## Key Insights
- Signup conversion is relatively strong, suggesting effective acquisition.
- A large percentage of users fail to progress from Signup to Add to Cart.
- Purchase conversion from Add to Cart is moderate, implying that users who reach this stage have higher intent.

---

## Business Implications
- The Signup → Add to Cart step represents the highest revenue leakage.
- Potential causes include unclear pricing, weak onboarding, or insufficient value messaging.
- Improving this stage could significantly increase overall revenue without increasing acquisition spend.

---

## Recommendations
1. Improve onboarding flow immediately after signup.
2. Test clearer pricing and value propositions.
3. Introduce incentives (e.g., trials, discounts) to encourage Add to Cart actions.
4. Monitor funnel metrics weekly to track improvements.

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how funnel-based metrics can identify high-impact optimization opportunities. Addressing mid-funnel friction is likely to yield the greatest return on investment.
